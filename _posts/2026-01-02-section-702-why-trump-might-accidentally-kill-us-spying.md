Hey there, Yang Hong here. Today is January 2, 2026, hoping you stay in good.

It is the ultimate "be careful what you wish for" moment. For four years, Donald Trump campaigned against the "Deep State" and its surveillance powers. Now, Congress is asking him a terrifying question: "Do you want to renew the subscription to the spy machine, now that you are the one holding the remote control?"

It’s the "Switching Sides" Paradox.

Normally, the Democrats are the party of institutional trust—they generally support the Intelligence Community. And the Republicans, specifically the libertarian wing, are the ones screaming about privacy and warrants.

But with Trump back in the White House, the poles are flipping. Democrats are suddenly realizing that Section 702—the law that lets the NSA sweep up foreign communications (and some American data along with it)—is now a weapon in the hands of a President they fundamentally do not trust.

And Trump? He’s the wildcard. He hates the FBI’s leadership, but he loves executive power. So we are heading toward an April deadline where nobody knows who is on which side.

Now, while the intelligence community is sweating bullets about this expiring law, what is the Administration actually spending its energy on?

Golf courses.

I’m not joking. This week, the Trump administration terminated a 50-year lease with the National Links Trust to take back control of public golf courses in D.C. Why? Because Trump wants to redesign them. He’s also planning a "Triumphal Arch."

Think of the US Government like a high-end home security system. Section 702 is the master camera feed that watches the perimeter. It’s essential. But the new homeowner (Trump) is so obsessed with remodeling the front lawn and putting up a golden statue in the driveway, he’s ignoring the fact that the subscription to the security cameras expires in three months. And the neighbors (Congress)? They are so afraid the homeowner is going to spy on them that they are thinking about cutting the power line to the whole house.

 Trump’s desire to remodel D.C. is largely aesthetic—it’s "bread and circuses." It gets headlines. And Section 702 isn't some magical "spy on everyone" button. It has layers of oversight. Most of what it catches is foreign terrorists and cyber-criminals. If it lapses, we don't just lose the ability to spy on political enemies; we lose the ability to see actual threats moving in the dark.

This brings us to the "Intelligence Blackout" risk.

The math in Congress is razor-thin. The last time they tried to fix this, a warrant amendment failed on a 212-212 tie. It was dead even. Now, if Democrats decide to vote "No" purely to deny Trump the power, and the Freedom Caucus votes "No" because they hate the FBI... there is no majority.

We are staring at a scenario where the primary tool for US global intelligence simply turns off in April because the President was too busy building an Arch to whip the votes, and Congress was too paranoid to give him the keys.

If the world is as messy in April as it is today, flying blind is a very bad idea.

See you next time.
