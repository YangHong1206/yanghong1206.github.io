Hey there, Yang Hong here. Today is December 16th, 2025, hoping you stay in good.
There is a very specific phrase being used in Berlin right now: "European-led multinational force."
It sounds like cooperation. It sounds like responsible statecraft.
It sounds like the United States is officially outsourcing the danger of the Russian border to Brussels, while keeping the financial keys for itself.
The peace deal on the table isn't just about ending the war in Ukraine.
It is about shifting the physical risk of checking Russia onto the shoulders of the Europeans.

The news reports are coming fast, but the architecture is clear.
On the security side: The deal calls for a "European-led" force to operate inside Ukraine.
That means German, French, and Polish soldiers standing guard on the cease-fire line.
If the shooting starts again, it is European blood on the line.
Meanwhile, look at the economic side.
The reports explicitly mention a "Prosperity Package" to rebuild Ukraine, with heavy involvement from BlackRock and the World Bank.
This is the Risk Transfer.
The United States is pivoting. We are moving from being the "Global Policeman" to being the "Global Banker."
We are happy to finance the reconstruction—and collect the interest—but we are done providing the bodies to defend the border.

Imagine a dangerous neighborhood.
For 70 years, Uncle Sam was the Sheriff. He patrolled the streets. He took the risks.
Now, Uncle Sam is handing the badge to Europe. He says, "You patrol the street. You take the bullets if the gangs come back."
"But," he adds, "I still own the bank that holds the mortgage on all the houses."

From Washington's perspective, this is brilliant statecraft.
The US has to focus on the Pacific and China. We cannot be tied down in the Donbas forever.
But the structural implication for Europe is massive.
This deal effectively binds Europe to a permanent state of military tension.
If 800,000 Ukrainian troops plus a European coalition are the only thing stopping the Russian army, Europe cannot decouple from the US security umbrella.
They are stuck.
They have to buy American weapons, follow American sanctions, and rely on American intelligence, because their own soldiers are now directly in the line of fire.

The deal works on paper. But what happens if the ceasefire fails?
If a skirmish breaks out and fifty German soldiers are killed by a Russian artillery strike, Berlin will look to Washington for help.
And Washington might point to the "European-led" clause and say, "That’s your sector. Handle it."
The Trade-off is clear.
The US secures its financial interests (The Rebuild) and frees up its military bandwidth for Asia.
Europe gets a buffer state, but pays for it with indefinite military exposure.
We are witnessing the Korean War solution applied to Europe: A permanent, militarized border that freezes the conflict but locks the allies into a rigid, dangerous structure for decades.
