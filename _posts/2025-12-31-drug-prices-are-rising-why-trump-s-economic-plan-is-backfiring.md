Hey there, Yang Hong here. Today is December 31, 2025, the last day of the year, hoping you stay in good.

There is a saying in markets: "Price is truth." And right now, the price of your prescription drugs is telling a very different story than the White House press secretary. While the administration claims victory on affordability, the data shows that starting tomorrow—January 1st—at least 350 branded medications are getting more expensive.

We need to talk about the disconnect between the "Political Economy" and the "Real Economy."

If you listen to the speeches from the White House, the war on high prices is over. They struck deals for Medicaid. They launched "TrumpRx." They are claiming a massive win. But if you look at the actual filings from the pharmaceutical companies—Pfizer, Sanofi, GSK—they are raising prices by a median of 4% on hundreds of drugs.

This includes the stuff you actually use: COVID vaccines, RSV shots, and cancer treatments like Ibrance.

So, what is happening? It’s a classic economic shell game.

The Trump administration used heavy pressure—threats of tariffs—to force drug companies to lower prices for Medicaid and for cash buyers. That’s the headline.

But here is the structural reality: Pharmaceutical companies are not charities. They have profit margins to protect. When the government forces them to cut prices in, they simply raise prices in Private Insurance to make up the difference.

Think of the drug market like a water balloon. The President just squeezed one end of the balloon really hard. And sure enough, the water moved away from his hand. He looks like a genius. But where did the water go? It just bulged out on the other side. That "other side" is your private health insurance premium. You aren't paying less; the cost just shifted from your tax bill to your insurance bill.

Inflation is technically cooling. Food prices only ticked up 0.1% recently. We aren't in the hyper-inflation zone of a few years ago. But—and this is the critical "but"—voters don't grade on a curve. They grade on the receipt. And right now, 61% of Americans say the President is misleading them about prices.

 This brings us to the political risk for 2026. I call it the "Competence Trap."

We are seeing a fascinating shift in the swing-voter data, specifically out of places like North Carolina. The exact same voters who abandoned Biden because of inflation and age are now looking at Trump and saying... "Wait a minute."

They see him nodding off in meetings. They see him calling affordability concerns a "hoax." And they see their bills staying high. The irony is thick: Trump is risking becoming the very thing he ran against—an out-of-touch leader presiding over an economy that people feel is broken, regardless of what the stock market says.

If this "Shadow Inflation" continues—where headline numbers look good but your actual cost of living keeps climbing—the GOP is walking into a massacre in the 2026 midterms.

The math suggests that you can't gaslight a grocery bill.
