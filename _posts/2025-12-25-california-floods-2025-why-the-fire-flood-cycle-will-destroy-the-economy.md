Hey there, Yang Hong here. Today is December 25, 2025, hoping you stay in good.

There is a dark irony to spending Christmas 2025 in California. We spent the first half of the year watching the state burn to the ground, and now we are watching the ashes wash away into the Pacific Ocean. Geography, as always, is undefeated.

If you look at the headlines, you see "Rain." You see the National Weather Service issuing a "High Risk" warning for Los Angeles. You see the I-5 shutting down in the San Fernando Valley. You see rescue crews pulling people out of cars in Wrightwood.

But if you just look at the water, you are missing the point. The water is just the trigger. The gun was loaded back in January.

This is what we call the "Multiplier Effect."

The reason this storm is "life-threatening"—and not just a wet weekend—is because of the burn scars. We had massive wildfires earlier this year in places like the Pacific Palisades and San Bernardino. When you burn land that hot, it changes the chemistry of the soil. It creates a waxy layer. The ground literally stops acting like a sponge and starts acting like a parking lot.

So, we have an atmospheric river dumping—what the forecasts say could be a foot of rain—onto a landscape that physically cannot drink it.

It’s simple physics. Gravity takes over. The water grabs the ash, the rocks, and the loose topsoil, and it turns into liquid concrete moving at thirty miles per hour. That’s what a debris flow is. It doesn't just flood a house; it erases it.

Think of the California landscape like a giant bathtub. Normally, the drain is open, and the water flows out. But the wildfires earlier this year effectively shoved a giant stopper in the drain. Now, we are turning the shower on full blast—that’s this storm. The water has nowhere to go but over the edge, flooding the bathroom floor. That floor is Los Angeles County.

California has always been a geologically violent place. Not every hill is going to slide. The evacuation orders are specific—about 130 homes in the most vulnerable zones. Most people will just have a wet, miserable Christmas. But the pattern is accelerating. The recovery time between the "Fire Season" and the "Flood Season" is hitting zero. They are starting to overlap.

Here is the risk that matters for the next decade. It’s not the mud; it’s the money. Specifically, insurance money.

We are looking at a "Capital Flight" scenario for California real estate. Insurance companies are math nerds. They hate uncertainty. But what we are seeing isn't uncertainty anymore; it's a certainty.

In the last three years alone, premiums in these high-risk zones haven't just adjusted for inflation; they have verticalized. We are seeing average rate hikes of 34% to 50% year-over-year. In some of these canyon neighborhoods, the annual insurance premium has crossed $15,000.

If a property is statistically guaranteed to burn in the summer and slide into the ocean in the winter, you cannot insure it.

The math implies that private insurers are going to pack up and leave. In fact, State Farm and Allstate already started the exodus back in '23 and '24. This puts the entire California housing market at massive risk of becoming uninsurable by the private sector.

This puts the entire California housing market at massive risk of becoming uninsurable by the private sector. And when the private sector leaves, who steps in? You do. The federal taxpayer becomes the insurer of last resort for the 5th largest economy in the world.

While Washington is distracted fighting over security clearances and political lawsuits

The maps are changing. Stay dry out there.

See you next time.
