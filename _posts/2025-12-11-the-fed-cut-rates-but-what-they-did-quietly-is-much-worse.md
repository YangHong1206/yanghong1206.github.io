Hey there, Yang Hong here. Today is December 11th, hoping you stay in good.

Imagine you are driving a car at 70 miles per hour. Suddenly, the windshield gets covered in mud, and your GPS turns off. A rational person hits the brakes. The Federal Reserve? They just decided to hit the gas.

Yesterday, the Fed cut interest rates. That’s the headline.  They are restarting the machinery that pumps cash into the system. And they are doing it while the inflation dashboard is still flashing red.

Everyone is focused on the "Rate Cut." But the real story is in the plumbing. The Fed announced they will start buying $40 billion in Treasury securities starting Friday. They call it "Reserve Management."

This is a massive shift. For the last two years, the Fed was selling bonds to pull money out of the economy. They were trying to cool things down. Now? They are buying again. They are cutting the cost of money (rates) and increasing the supply of money (buying bonds) at the same time. And they are doing this when inflation is still sitting at 2.8%.

$40 billion a month. That sounds like a generic government number.  That is roughly the GDP of a small country like Jordan or Bahrain... every single month. They are injecting that much liquidity back into the banking system.

The Fed argues this is just technical maintenance to keep the plumbing flowing, not a full-blown stimulus package. But the signal is clear: The Fed is terrified of the bond market freezing up.

And look at the inflation number: 2.8%. The target is 2%. We are almost 50% above the target. Think of it like a fever. Your normal temperature is 98.6°F (37°C). You are running at 101°F. You aren't dying, but you are definitely sick. And instead of taking antibiotics, the doctor just gave you a shot of espresso.

This creates a Scale Mismatch. The stock market rallied 500 points because they love the "espresso." But the "Dot Plot"—the internal forecast—shows a fractured board. A 9-3 vote split. That’s not a consensus. That is a boardroom brawl. Half the Fed thinks we are going too fast; the other half wants to go faster.

It is the Inflation Floor. The math suggests that if you keep monetizing the debt (buying Treasurys) while the economy is growing, you cannot get inflation back to 2%. It’s physically impossible.

The Trade-off is structural. We might be entering an era where 3% or 4% inflation is the new normal. That means your grocery bill never goes back down. It just keeps climbing, year after year. The Fed seems to have decided that saving the bond market is more important than hitting their inflation target. They are keeping the lights on in the financial system, but the electricity bill is going to be paid by your savings account.
